# My Cutting Board App

* User scans the NFC tag on their cutting board
* They are brought to a page with information on their board
  * Image(s)
  * List and description of woods used
  * Link to YT video of it's creation
  * Contact link for RILW

* If they go directly to the web page they are prompted to enter their board's ID

* For now this will all just be publicly available endpoints

## TODO

* Add requests class to handle getting boards from the backend
* Write the layout for showing a cutting board's information

* Add logic for signing in, up, and out
* Add component to show logged in data with cutting board data
